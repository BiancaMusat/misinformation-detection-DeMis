## üìö Data Sets
The data sets about COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter presented in [our paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oQL5R5YiaO3Wdj6o7Nqd7BVAN2kSMxN8/view?usp=sharing) are available below.

- COMYTH (weather & home-remedies) - [[Datasets](https://portals.mdi.georgetown.edu/public/misinformation-detection)]
- COVIDLies - [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-2.11/)]

## üöÄ Pre-trained Models
We release our models for misinformation detection on Twitter trained using DeMis method. There are three models trained on three COVID-19 misinformation data sets separately. All trained misinformation detection models are available on my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1czX7oh_pvQaYsY3w-RjPZrZEE9v_d8dW?usp=sharing) ü§ó so you can download models via PyTorch and use it for prediction right away!!!

- [DeMis-COMYTH-W](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7AAP7aw9KzPtz0JC8T_XYCpV2dFMs9e/view?usp=sharing) (trained on COVID-weather data)
- [DeMis-COMYTH-H](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19n02CFvEbQJ2hRL9noU3vVLCIqY-WtjW/view?usp=sharing) (trained on COVID-home-remedies data)
- [DeMis-COVIDLies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Hc5IhYqKI5fxNkLZqgnQ8KwO-waGtSu/view?usp=sharing) (trained on COVIDLies data)

## ‚öôÔ∏è ~Usage~ (coming soon)
We tested in `pytorch v1.10.1` and `transformers v4.18.0`.

### Train using DeMis
1. Run script `sh run_weak_annotator.sh` to generate weak labels based on similarity between unlabeled tweets and claims. Note that this will also generate similarity matrix so we can reuse it for other myth themes by adding `similarity_matrix_filepath` argument to the shell script.
2. Run `sh run_get_balanced_weak_labeled_data.sh` to build a balanced set of weak labeled data.
3. Run `sh run_sim_sentence_embedding_strong_labeled.sh` to generate similarity matrix between strong-labeled tweets and claims. No need to generate similarity matrix for unlabeled tweets since it is already done in the step 1.
4. Run `sh run_build_info_for_RL_state.sh` to build state information. Both stong and weak labeled data must have been proceesed.
5. Run `sh run_generate_sentence_embeddings` to create sentence embedding matrix for calculating max/min similarity during the state creation as an element of state info.
6. Run `sh train_demis.sh` to train the model.
