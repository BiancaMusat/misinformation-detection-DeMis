## üìö Data Sets
The data sets about COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter presented in [our paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oQL5R5YiaO3Wdj6o7Nqd7BVAN2kSMxN8/view?usp=sharing) are available below.

- COMYTH (weather & home-remedies) - [[Datasets](https://portals.mdi.georgetown.edu/public/misinformation-detection)]
- COVIDLies - [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-2.11/)]

## üöÄ ~Pre-trained Models~ (coming soon)
We release our models for misinformation detection on Twitter trained using DeMis method. There are three models trained on three COVID-19 misinformation data sets separately. All trained misinformation detection models are available on my [Google Drive](XXX) ü§ó so you can download models via PyTorch and use it for prediction right away!!!

- ~[DeMis-COMYTH-W](XXX) (trained on COVID-weather data)~
- ~[DeMis-COMYTH-H](XXX) (trained on COVID-home-remedies data)~
- ~[DeMis-COVIDLies](XXX) (trained on COVIDLies data)~

## ‚öôÔ∏è ~Usage~ (coming soon)
We tested in `pytorch v1.10.1` and `transformers v4.18.0`.
